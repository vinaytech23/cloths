Lessons Continue Worldwide for Wells Musicians
During the final week of the Lent Term, Wells musicians are continuing to have instrumental lessons from their specialist teachers, but are learning from the comfort of their homes around the world, rather than the music rooms in Mullins, Polydor, Cedars Hall or the Music School.

So far this week, cello teacher, Richard May, has ‘visited’ Sweden, the Cayman Islands, China and various locations across the UK, without leaving his front door!
